### Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code is an approach to describe and manage on-premise or cloud resources. There are 2 types of IaC tools:

* Configuration management tools (Ansible, Chef, Puppet)
* Orchestration (Terraform, CloudFormation)

Configuration management tools are aimed at modifying the existing infrastructure, which is close to the procedural approach. Some of the configuration tools are also overlapped with orchestration.

Orchestration tools work declaratively. They describe the infrastructure and keep its state.
