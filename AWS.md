#### How to make CloudFront never cache index.html on S3 bucket
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45727454/how-to-make-cloudfront-never-cache-index-html-on-s3-bucket

A solution based on CloudFront configuration:

Go to your CloudFront distribution, under the "Behavior" tab and create a new behavior. Specify the following values:

Path Pattern: index.html
Object Caching: customize
Maximum TTL: 0 (or another very small value)
Default TTL: 0 (or another very small value)
Save this configuration.

CloudFront will not cache index.html anymore.
